      <p>Welcome to the Warehouse</p>
      <button class="enter">Enter</button>
    </div>
    <div class="text-block"  id="page1">
      <p>
        You awaken in a dimly lit room. As as you become less disoriented, you notice a throbbing pain in the back of your head. Upon running your fingers through your hair, you discover crusty blood from the source of the throbbing. After sitting up and looking around the room, you notice a door and a poorly boarded-up window. Otherwise, the room is barren. How did you get here? Surely, you did not decide to take a nap. It’s probably a good idea to get out of here. 
        <br>
        It would seem the door has been locked from the outside. It would also seem there is a pretty good drop from the window, though you might be able to land in some trash to help break the fall.
      </p>
      <button class="button button2">Try to kick down the door</button>
      <button class="button button3">Jump out the window</button>
    </div>
    <div class="text-block" id="page2">
      <p> 
        You kick the door with all you’ve got. With a thunderous boom, the door gives way and you fall back on your ass. With added soreness, you make your way through the door to a long hallway. The wall of the hall are made of corrugated metal. There are no doors, but there is a split at the end. To the right is a rusty diamond plate staircase leading down into darkness, but possibly an exit. There is a similar staircase to the left, but it seems to go to a warehouse. In fact, you hear the murmur of several voices off in the direction. There are probably people there, but who are they?
      </p>
      <button class="button button5">Descend into darkness</button>
      <button class="button button8">Head toward the voices</button>
    </div>
    <div class="text-block"  id="page3">
      <p>
        You peer out the window and hesitate for a moment. It seems to almost be dark. You can’t see the skyline, only the warehouse across the alley you are preparing to jump into.
        <br>
        You pull the poorly nailed boards from the window, squeeze into a crouching position on the sill, and jump feet first into the dumpster. Whether or not this was a good idea doesn’t matter anymore. Your throbbing head is a non-issue compared the horrendous pain sending lightning up your leg and resonating throughout your body. You seem to have done something terrible to your foot. In fact, there seems to be a sharp two-foot piece of metal skewering it. 
        <br>
        You need to do something about that, but should it really be done in the dumpster?
      </p>
      <button class="button button4">Attempt to climb out of the dumpster</button>
      <button class="button button12">Remove the metal from your foot</button>
    </div>
    <div class="text-block" id="page4">
      <p>
        Without pulling the metal from your foot, start climbing out of the dumpster. It is not easy with only one usable leg and the resulting pain. As a result, you slip back and land square on the metal-pierced foot. Overcome with pain, you black out.
        <br>
        The next day, you awaken to the slamming shut of the dumpster lid. You call out, but there is no chance to be heard over the roar of the truck taking you and the rest of the garage away. Unfortunately, you and the rest of the trash are compacted to death. 
      </p>

    </div>
    <div class="text-block" id="page5">
      <p>
        You head down the dark staircase. It’s cooler as you descend and your footsteps begin to echo back behind you. At the bottom, you find a door. Clearly, you must have passed the ground floor and are now underground. Perhaps this is a basement? Maybe a bomb shelter? In any case, you weren’t looking to head underground, just get out and figure out how you got here.
        <br>
        While rather frightening, you suppose it is possible that you could have came from this doorway.
      </p>
      <button class="button button6">Go through the door</button>
      <button class="button button8">Go back to the other staircase</button>
    </div>
    <div class="text-block" id="page6">
      <p>
        You head through the door at the bottom of the stairwell. As the door begins to open, you see a faint blue glow. Heading in, you see that some kind of plant or organism being grown here with a bio-luminescent quality. There is what appears to be a work bench with various scientific and botany tools. There is a mortar with a heavy blue glow, probably from grinding up the organism. A stack of notes was also left on the table. Maybe they have some information on what is going on here? Then again, maybe it’s best to keep moving, as there seems to be more rooms down here.
      </p>
      <button class="button button7">Read the notes</button>
      <button class="button button14">Keep moving to the next room</button>
    </div>
    <div class="text-block" id="page7">
      <p>
        While rather sciencey and indecipherable in many ways, the way the notes are written seems rather strange. The person who wrote these notes was doing very scientific tests on this plant, but they seem to speak of it in a reverential way. In fact, they don’t call it a plant. They don’t call it “it” either. They refer to the glowing blue thing as “Her”. Perhaps the scientist is just a little too involved in his work. Or maybe it’s a joke? You can’t help but wonder who you’re dealing with. But beyond that, you wonder what you’re doing here. They must be the one’s who injured you and put you in that room. Before you can contemplate this anymore, you hear low distant voices back from the direction you came. There is little time to make a decision, so you must either hide or head further down the passage.
      </p>
      <button class="button button13">Hide</button>
      <button class="button button14">Go further</button>
    </div>
    <div class="text-block" id="page8">
      <p>
        As you make your way through the junk filled warehouse toward the voices, you smell burning. You pause at to make sense of this and notice smoke up ahead. Your eyes follow the smoke up until you notice there is a very large hole in this warehouse’s roof. The people the voices are coming from must be having a fire. A strange thing to be doing here, but you proceed, as today has made little sense anyway.
        <br>
        You see the four men around their fire from behind. They don’t seem to have noticed you. Before you make your presence known to them, one of them turns him head enough to see the side of his face. Much to your alarm, you realize he, and the rest of the men seem to be.... glowing. They seem to be emanating blue light! You reconsider approaching them straight away. You gather that you could probably sneak back to the other stairway if you wanted, or you could try and listen in on their conversation, but that seems a tad risky.
      </p>
      <button class="button button6">Head back to the dark stairway</button>
      <button class="button button9">Eavesdrop</button>
    </div>
    <div class="text-block" id="page9">
      <p>
        The blue men, from what you can make out over the crackle of the fire have been working on some experiments with someone they keep referring to as “Her”. Besides being difficult to hear, the men are using a lot of very sciencey terms that fly way over your head. The one other thing that seemed to come up a lot was “Her Family”. You have to assume they are doing research as part of whatever organization Her Family is, but it still seems strange that they aren’t acknowledging the fact that they all seem to be glowing blue. Maybe it is just an optical illusion! You seriously wonder if that blow to the back of your head caused serious damage. One thing is certain though --  you’re not about to reveal yourself to them.
        <br>
        You could try and sneak past them, but the amount of junk around seems like it could be noisy. Besides that, there may still be a way out through the dark stairwell.
      </p>
      <button class="button button10">Sneak by</button>
      <button class="button button6">Go back to the dark stairway</button>
    </div>
    <div class="text-block" id="page10">
      <p>
        As you try to sneak by, you knock over a car door that was precariously perched atop a stack of boxes. You see it slip in slow motion and there’s nothing you can do. Good job, you’ve really done it this time.
        <br>
        There is a great commotion that echos through the warehouse. Within seconds the men from the fire descend upon you. You resist, but it is no use. They are uncommonly strong. They force something in your mouth and you black out.
      </p>
      <button class="button button11">Wake up!</button>
    </div>
    <div class="text-block" id="page11">
      <p>
        You awaken strapped to a board tilted upright. You can’t move your hands or feet due to shackles, but you’re able to move your head. You seem to be striped down to your underwear and... something is wrong, very wrong. Your whole body appears to be glowing blue. Apart from the horror of this discovery, you’ve noticed a hideous, sharp, snarled root coming from the floor that just so happens to be glowing a similar hue of blue. 
        <br>
        Finally, you hear two people approaching. One with a cart full of medical instruments, the other in full doctor’s garb, medical mask and goggles included. Despite the mask, you recognize the damned blue glow he was projecting.
        <br>
        You convulse in an attempt to break free of your shackles, but it is no use. Your fate is sealed.
        <br>
        With no way to resist, the doctor makes an incision on your chest. He then takes the horrific, evil, blue root protruding from the floor and moves it toward the incision.
        <br>
        Then, on its own, the root forces itself in, killing you and growing inside.
      </p>
      <button onClick="window.location.reload();">Try again</button>

    <div class="text-block" id="page12">
      <p>
        With great pain and difficulty, you remove the metal from your foot. You try to climb out from the dumpster, but repeated slip onto your injured foot. Despite the pain, you are eventually able to make it to the top of the dumpster and fall out. You limp about, only to discover each end of the alley is gated off. You get the idea to climb the gate, but the reality of your foot would make this impossible. The one way out seems to be a door back into the warehouse you just jumped from.
        <br>
        Much to your chagrin, you head back into the warehouse.
        <br>
        Inside, you discover a pair of staircases. One by you that goes up and the other descending from the top down through the floor. You figure that the room you were in was probably up there somewhere, but you’re curious about why the second staircase leads down into the ground. You head up to the top of the staircases to look and make a decision as to which way to go. Back in the warehouse you faintly hear voices. You could go to them for help, but who are they? The other option is this stairwell that leads straight into darkness. Neither option is particularly appealing.
      </p>
      <button class="button button5">Descend into darkness</button>
      <button class="button button8">Head toward the voices</button>
    </div>
    <div class="text-block" id="page13">
      <p>
        As the voices approach, you scramble to make yourself hidden. You do the best you can, but there isn’t much in the room big enough for you to hide in, under, or behind.
        <br>  
        You settle for a coat tree in the corner holding several lab coats. 
        <br>
        Unfortunately, the men entering the room head straight away to put on their lab coats, and to your terrible misfortune, they discover you. Before you can react or even get a good look, they overpower and incapacitate you. You’re knocked out.
      </p>
      <button class="button button11">Wake up</button>
    </div>
    <div class="text-block" id="page14">
      <p>
        You exit the lab room and move into what appears to be a bedroom for several people. There are four beds with footlockers, but other than that the room is empty. You check a couple lockers but there is nothing unexpected in them. The one interesting thing about the room, which you chose to distract yourself from with the footlockers, is the cavernous hole blown in the wall leading off for a great distance. And, wouldn’t you know it, the walls possess the glowing blue plants you saw before. The difference is, now they seem to sway and pulsate by themselves. The light is more intense. Despite it seeming like a terribly scary plan of action, you head down the cave. Heading back would only lead to the men you were avoiding.
        <br>
        After stumbling down the blue tunnel, you come to a split in the path. Either way is as viable as the other.
      </p>
      <button class="button button15">Go left</button>
      <button class="button button18">Go right</button>
    </div>
    <div class="text-block" id="page15">
      <p>
        You head down the left tunnel where the cave opens up into a space where an underground stream seems to be running. When you move closer to the stream, you catch a foul smell. Perhaps this is part of the sewer? No, this smell is... meaty.
        <br>
        Once you come to the side of the stream, you catch the color of the water. It’s a deep red that is almost blood-like. At the sides of the stream where the liquid has dried is a sticky tar-like black goo.
        <br>
        By the river, you notice a continuation of your path up ahead, but also that you might be able to walk through the tunnel that red stream has carved.
      </p>
      <button class="button button16">Cross the stream</button>
      <button class="button button17">Go down the stream</button>
    </div>
    <div class="text-block" id="page16">
      <p>
        You get to the other side of the stream, but the goo on the shore seems to be a lot thicker than expected. In fact it seems even stickier than before. You hasten your struggle to get back to the path, but the goo will just not have it. Before you know it, you are up to your waist and the goo seems to be swirling and boiling around you.  It completely covers your face and you’re barely able to breath. In the midst of this, several hands grab you and pull you off in some direction. Eventually you’re able to call out, but they club you, rendering you unconscious. 

      </p>
      <button class="button button11">Wake Up</button>
    </div>
    <div class="text-block" id="page17">
      <p>
        As you head down the stream, it seems to be uncommonly warm -- though, you aren’t that experienced in sour red underground streams.
        <br>
        For a while, the tunnel darkens as it twists and turns underground. But after a while, the blue organisms light the way again.
        <br>
        Slowly, the tunnel begins to open up until you find yourself in a huge open cave containing a hideous, snarled, sharp, glowing, blue root ball. Whatever these roots are for must be one of the most massive plants out there. It’s like nothing you’ve ever seen.
        <br>
        The pulsation of the light on the roots is captivating.
        <br>
        As you venture closer to the roots, you notice several dozen people kneeling below it. They are kneeling in the black goo from the stream, and, perhaps unsurprisingly, emanating blue light.
        <br>
        As much as you would like to turn back, there is something captivating about the scene.
        <br>
        Then, on some level, you feel as if you’ve been notice. Everything glowing glue in the cave hastens it pulse. You can’t help but be drawn in toward the you roots. You approach and are instinctively moved to your knees. The black goo cements you to the cave floor and the light keeps pulsing.
        <br>
        The pulsing lights drain the life from body.

      <button onClick="window.location.reload();">Try again</button>
    </div>
    <div class="text-block" id="page18">
      <p>
        As you head down the right path, you notice the cave sides seem to have narrowed. This continues on until you begin to have to crawl. It would seem as the cave gets narrower the glowing blue that has lit the way has been dimming. Now, as you combat crawl on further, it is totally black. Luckily, the cave is so narrow you don’t really need to see. After a while in the dark, you feel the cave floor moisten. Along with the moisture comes a disgusting, sweet, meaty smell. As the moisture dries on you, it forms an uncomfortable sticky goo.
        <br>
        Eventually, the tunnel begins to light up again. You notice that the goo is the blackest thing you have ever seen. The moisture you encountered in the tunnel is a deep blood red. 
        <br>
        Finally, the cave opens until you are at the edge of a sharp drop. Beyond the drop is a huge cavern containing a giant, blue, hideous, pulsating root ball. You gather that the plat it must go to has to be the biggest you’ve ever seen.
        <br>
        You see a collapsed part of the cavern that you could either climb up beyond where you can see or go down toward the root.
      </p>
      <button class="button button19">Go up</button>
      <button class="button button20">Go down</button>
    </div>
    <div class="text-block" id="page19">
      <p>
        As you climb up, you struggled with the shifting rock. It dangerously slides around you, but you persevere on up into a tunnel. Ahead you see a light, but not the kind you’ve been seeing a lot of. No, this is golden sunlight.
        <br>
        Finally, you find yourself outside the ungodly cavern you passed through.
        <br>
        Much to your surprise you find yourself a great distance from a grouping of dilapidated warehouses and... nothing else. For as far as you can see there is nothing but tundra. Which way is home? How did you get here? Where were you taken? That blow to you back of the head surely can’t have been all that made you forget, could it?
        <br>
        But no matter. Heading of in any direction is fine so long as it’s away from that warehouse.
